The ICON Bridge is an openâ€‘source blockchain interoperability application. It is a fork from the [Blockchain Transmission Protocol](https://github.com/icon-project/btp) and differs in that message verification is done off-chain.

> **_NOTE:_**  The ICON Bridge is currently in beta and has not completed auditing. Use at your own risk.
