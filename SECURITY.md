# Security Policy

The ICON Bridge is in early development and may contain security vulnerabilities.

## Security Audit

The ICON Bridge is currently being audited. We will make the audit report public after it is complete
and all discovered vulnerabilities have been addressed.

## Bug Bounty

TBD after audit completes.

## Supported Versions

Please see the [releases page](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/releases) for the list of supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All security related issues should be reported via email to security@icon.foundation. We will attempt to respond within 2 business days to all reported issues.

## Fixing a Vulnerability

Development for security issues should be done in a private fork and publicly commited ONLY after the fix is already on mainnet.
[See Github's steps on how to develop in a private fork](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-repository-security-vulnerability).
