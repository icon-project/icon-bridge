Deployment Involves the following steps:
1. NODES:                  There should be icon and bsc nodes running (either as testnet/mainnet) or as local docker containers
2. BUILD_ARTIFACTS:        Build artifacts (jar & node_modules) need to be created
3. DEPLOY_SMART_CONTRACTS: Smart Contracts should be deployed on these icon and bsc nodes using build artifacts
4. RELAY_CONFIG:           After smart contract deployment completes, the deployment artifacts includes relay config bmr.config.json
5. RELAY_RUN:              Relay (also called bmr, iconbridge) should be run
6. USE_CASES:              Deployment artifacts include addresses.json, Use the contract addresses mentioned there for any use cases (e.g. token transfer)

Alternatives To Deploying ICON_BRIDGE:
1. Deploy on PC
    1.1 Full Deployment        (Useful for newcomers. All the steps done inside a docker container. )
    1.2 Piecewise Deployment    (Useful for developers. Steps run on docker+PC)
2. Deploy on Mainnet/Testnet


1. Deploy on PC
    1.1 Full Deployment
        make cleanimglocal        #Clean Previous build & deployment artifacts if present
        make buildimglocal        #Build BMR,BSC,ICON images
        make runimglocal          #Run containers. deploys smart contract, run relay
        Optional:
            make removeimglocal   #Cleans artifacts and also removes previously built images

1.2 PieceWise Deployment
    #Install Dependencies on PC
    make buildsc                    #Builds smart contracts
    make buildnodes                 #Build ICON & BSC nodes
    make runnodes                   #RUN ICON & BSC nodes locally
    make deploysclocalnet           #Deploy smart contracts on ICON & BSC nodes
    make runrelaysrc                #Run relay from source
        Optional:                   #Run relay from docker container instead of source
            make stoprelayimg       #Stop relay docker container (if present)
            make buildrelayimg      #Build relay docker image 
            make runrelayimg        #Run relay docker container
        Optional:
            make stopnodes          #Stop icon & bsc nodes
            make cleanartifacts     #Clean artifacts generated by smart contract deployment


2 Deploy on Mainnet/Testnet
    make buildsc                    #Builds smart contracts
    make deploysctesstnet           #Deploy smart contracts on Testnet. Using scripts/config.sh
    make runrelaysrc                #Run relay from source
        Optional:                   #Run relay from docker container instead of source
            make stoprelayimg       #Stop relay docker container (if present)
            make buildrelayimg      #Build relay docker image 
            make runrelayimg        #Run relay docker container
        Optional:
            make cleanartifacts     #Clean artifacts generated by smart contract deployment
