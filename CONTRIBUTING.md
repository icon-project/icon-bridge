## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check  **[our list of issues](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/issues)** to see if an
issue already exists.
> **Note:** For existing issues, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new issue. If the issue is closed and
> the problem persists, please open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

When you are creating a bug report, please fill out [the required template](https://github.com/icon-project/icon-bridge/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md) and include as many details as possible.

### Contributing Code

If you want to contribute, start working through the icon-bridge repository, navigate to the Github "issues" tab and start looking through issues. We recommed issues labeled "good first issue". These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for newcomers. If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue comment thread to coordinate.

Please see the [ICON Foundation Development Guidelines](https://github.com/icon-project/community/blob/main/guidelines/technical-development/development-guidelines.md)
for information regarding our development standards and practices.
